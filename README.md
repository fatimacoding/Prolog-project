Perfume Recommender System Using Artificial intelligence <br />
The AI approach to creating a perfume recommender involves designing an
expert system with Prolog, which can process user inputs about scent preferences,
occasions, and intensity. Through Prolog's logic rules, the system matches these
inputs against a database of perfume characteristics, effectively suggesting
options that align with the user's preferences. This methodology leverages the
strengths of Prolog in handling complex queries and making logical inferences,
providing a sophisticated tool for personalised perfume recommendations.
